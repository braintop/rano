1.	Spin Klintm Disc – this technology operates using thin, color-coded discs of a specific micron size. The discs are grooved on both sides, in opposite directions, creating a series of crossing points which form multiple particle traps. A series of discs are stacked and compressed on a specially designed spine, producing a matrix of consecutive crossing points which trap the particles, thus creating a depth filtration element.

2.	Suction-scanning Screen – this technology incorporates a multi-layer stainless steel screen with focused flush to provide 100% cleaning of the screen area, using less than 1% of the total process water for cleaning. The self-cleaning cycle is triggered by the accumulation of suspended solids (filter cake) on the screen surface, as measured by the pressure differential. Because cleaning is performed as needed, it results in minimal water and energy waste. Suction-scanning technology eliminates the need to isolate the filter during the self-cleaning cycle. The focused cleaning and the minimal exhaust requirement allow for uninterrupted process flow.

3.	Media – this technology, also known as depth filtration, is filtering water through a thick layer of graded particles (sand, gravel or other granular materials), called the filter bed. Raw water enters from the filter inlet and percolates through the filter bed, and suspended materials attach to the media particles. Filtered water flows through the filtration nozzles and out through the filter’s outlet. Backwashing: pressurized water flows in the reverse direction, from the nozzles upwards, causing suspension of the filter bed and releasing the suspended matter from the bedding. The dirt particles are then washed out of through the back-flush valve.

4.	Microfiber – this technology uses threads wound in layers around a grooved plastic spool cassette, removing dirt particles as water flows through multi-layered microfibers to the collecting pipes and out of the filter via outlets. The accumulation of dirt particles causes differential pressure. At a preset pressure differential value or time interval, the control unit activates the self-cleaning cycle.",

Apoptosis (programmed cell death) is the body's natural way of eliminating unwanted cells safely, without releasing toxins or triggering an immune response. 

Aposense has developed a novel class of rationally designed small molecules, which selectively identify cells from the early stages of apoptosis, cross the membrane and accumulate within the cell. The small weight molecules have a versatile structure, making them amenable to attachment and delivery of various imaging or therapeutic moieties to the apoptotic cells. These molecules can serve as a platform for imaging apoptotic cells and tissues or for targeted delivery of an active drug.

High A3AR expression levels are also found in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with inflammatory and cancer diseases, reflecting A3AR expression in the pathological remote sites. Targeting the receptor with synthetic and highly selective A3AR agonists, such as Can-Fite’s compounds CF101 and CF102, induces anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects. In addition, the receptor is suggested as a biological marker based on human clinical data showing that high receptor expression at baseline predicts good patient’s response to drug treatment.

Our products are based on our rhCollagen (recombinant human collagen) that is produced with CollPlant’s proprietary plant based genetic engineering technology.
 
Our products address indications for the diverse fields of organ and tissue repair, and are ushering in a new era in regenerative medicine. Our flagship rhCollagen BioInk product line is ideal for 3D bioprinting of tissues and organs. We recently entered into a licensing agreement with United Therapeutics, whereby United Therapeutics is using CollPlant’s BioInks in the manufacture of 3D bioprinted lungs for transplant in humans. CollPlant’s unique Vergenix line of rhCollagen products includes a soft tissue repair matrix for treating tendinopathy and a wound repair matrix to promote a rapid optimal healing of acute and chronic wounds.",https://www.collplant.com,Yehiel Tal,CEO,Mr.,yehiel@collplant.com,972-54-553-8888,Eran Rotem,Deputy CEO & CFO,eran@collplant.com,972-54-473-6344,,,,,4 Oppenheimer St.,Rehovot,,Israel,info@collplant.com,972-73-232-5600,Eran Rotem,eran@collplant.com,972-73-232-5600,info@collplant.com,"The production of Collplant’s rhCollagen (recombinant human collagen) begins when seedlings of tobacco plants genetically engineered with five human genes essential for the production of collagen are distributed to qualified greenhouses across Israel, where they are grown to maturity, which takes about eight weeks. The tobacco leaves are then harvested and processed to an extract, which undergoes purification until the final rhCollagen product is produced. Cost effective production, the abundant supply of raw materials, and the resulting product, pristine human collagen, are the most important features of plant based production. They are advancing a new production process that will result in higher yields and labor cost reductions, assuring adequate supply as demand for rhCollagen increases.

Their rhCollagen has demonstrated superior biological function when compared to any tissue derived collagen, whether from animal or human tissues according to data published in peer reviewed scientific publications. Their rhCollagen can be fabricated in different forms, shapes, and viscosities including gels, pastes, sponges, sheets, membranes, fibers, and thin coats, all of which have been tested in vitro and in animal models and proven superior to tissue derived products. These different forms of our rhCollagen broaden the potential applications of our products. For example, collagen gels made of their rhCollagen are more homogenous and less viscous compared to tissue derived collagen, making the rhCollagen gels ideal for any injectable product. They have demonstrated that, due to its homogeneity, rhCollagen can produce fibers and membranes with high molecular order, meaning all the molecules are oriented in the same direction, which enables the formation of tissue repair products with distinctive physical properties, including improved tensile strength due to the alignment of the collagen fibers, higher levels of transparency, and the ability to achieve high concentrations of collagen at low viscosities. The unique properties of our rhCollagen make it an ideal building block for many products such as BioInks for 3 D printing, artificial tendons, and transparent ophthalmic products that we believe cannot currently be produced using tissue derived collagen.

They can produce our rhCollagen cost effectively and have access to an abundant supply of raw materials. Tobacco is a relatively easy plant to grow, and can be cultivated in a wide range of climates and soils. The tobacco plant is an extremely hardy plant, may be grown in very large volumes and its growth time to reach desired maturity is relatively short (about eight weeks). Under their current production technology, we are able to achieve a cost of goods that allows us to offer products at prices that are competitive with tissue derived collagen.",

The float is made in the form of a leak-proof capacity with a definite configuration of walls . The floater’s foredeck directed against an incident wave has a pointed triangular shape, with chamfers towards the floater’s bottom. At that, a surface confronting waves can have both a flat and curvilinear configuration. Thus, an incident surf wave reinforces a vertical force of the floater’s ascent and getting to the “wedge” formed by foredecks of neighboring pontoons, moves them apart and protects from sides clash. It facilitates decrease in lateral loads of pontoon fastenings to a pier and increase in a construction operation life.

The “Power Wing” – When operating at different heights of waves, the float provides stable operation by means of combination of several effects originating during operation. At low waves on a water surface (up to 0.5 of float depth) and low speed of wave run-up, the construction works as an ordinary float, and float surfacing force participates in lifting force creation. At a mean wave (up to 1.5 of float depth) and average speed of wave run-up, a float lifting force acts the part, as well as an additional volume of air enclosed under the “wing” due to the effect of “hydraulic lock”, when an incident wave is higher than the float and locks some part of air under a float at run-up; this air works as an additional effective volume increasing an effective volume of the float and lifting force.At a rather high wave (more than 1.5 of float depth) and run-up speed, the construction will work as a float + “hydrofoil” creating a lifting force due to a kinetic energy of moving water, Archimedes Power and hydro dynamic power.",Climate Tech

By converting small vehicles to operate on Natural Gas, Energtek reduces the harmful environmental damage caused by these highly polluting vehicles. In addition, Energtek can dramatically reduce driver's annual fuel costs.

Adsorbed Natural Gas (ANG) Technology enables greater efficiency in the storage of Natural Gas compared to other methods.

Adsorption is the adhesion of molecules of liquids, gases, and dissolved substances to the surface of a solid. The ability of a solid to adsorb depends on the chemical makeup of the solid and its physical structure. Activated charcoal, for example, has a very large surface area because of its porous nature. This gives it the ability to adsorb large quantities of natural gas.

In a conventional high-pressure storage tank, such as a propane tank used for a backyard barbecue, gas is forced into the tank under pressure. The greater the pressure, the greater the volume of gas stored in the tank. The maximum pressure, and therefore volume of gas held in the tank, is limited by the physical properties of the tank and its valve.

The addition of a microporous material into the tank, such as activated carbon, makes it possible to do one of two things:

Store a larger volume of natural gas in the same container, at the same pressure.
Store the same volume of natural gas in the container at a lower pressure.
Until now the commercialization of Adsorbed Natural Gas technology was hindered by several unsolved technological problems including :

Sufficient volumetric storage ability competitive with existing NG storage methods.
Efficient gas filling and release from an ANG tank for automotive application
ANG fueling system cost competitive with the cost of existing fueling systems.

Solutions:
Network Virtualization and SDN
A shift toward network function virtualization (NFV) and software-defined networks (SDN) can be effective because many nodes within a network share the common functionality requirements, however virtualization has its own challenges. Software programmability alone won’t be enough to enable generic hardware to scale easily with growing bandwidth demands. A programmable hardware and software infrastructure is the only way to truly implement the vision of NFV and SDN. Ethernity’s product offering supports creation of re-programmable hardware solutions.

Broadband Access
The market requirements for broadband access lead to development of a platform that supports higher throughput, new applications, protocols and interfaces without implementing a special new silicon. Combining Ethernity Networks efficient ENET architecture with FPGA create a family of products tailored to the needs of access aggregation and interworking platforms. Ethernity’s ENET access flow processors have the best available combination of performance, feature set, flexibility, and price.
   
Mobile Backhaul
Mobile backhaul experiences a major paradigm shift from current PDH and ATM transport to Ethernet based networks. The two main factors driving this transition are the dramatic increase in bandwidth demand and pressure on mobile operators to reduce costs. This is true also for two types of network elements that any mobile backhaul network requires: Cell Tower Gateway and Network Edge Aggregator. Ethernity’s access processors provide the best solution for designing efficient and cost effective CTGs and NEAs
  
Carrier Ethernet Switching
Carrier grade Ethernet services support a range of applications more easily, efficiently and cost-effectively than other network services. Ethernet services will undoubtedly evolve to take advantage of Ethernet technology and provide innovative new service features. It is clear that Ethernet services will continue to provide the benefits of simplicity, cost effectiveness and flexibility that are unmatched for a wide range of applications. Ethernity’s ENET access flow processors (AFP) are the first devices in the industry implemented on a low cost FPGA.
  
Radio Access
Wireless transmission is achieved today by two main technologies such as point-to-point line-of-sight communications or Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN). Ethernity offers a unique packet transmission solution for carrier grade scalable 10G mesh wireless backbone in point-to-point and mesh network based on the off-the-shelf wireless technology with maximum availability and scalability. As a result the scalable solution provides dramatic CAPEX and OPEX reduction

It achieves this by blocking the action of the orexin-A and orexin-B neuropeptides at both orexin1 and orexin 2 receptors (OX1 and OX2). Orexin peptides activate these receptors, leading to transient increases in intracellular calcium levels in these neurons.
 
The neuropeptides orexin-A and Orexin-B are synthesized by a discrete number of neurons in the hypothalamus areas, regions involved in arousal, emotional and metabolic regulation, and motivated behaviors. The anatomical distribution of these neurons and receptors, which is highly consistent among vertebrate species, supports their essential role in the regulation of vigilance states and circadian activity.
 
Nerve fibers from orexin immunoreactive neurons make wide and dense projections to the basal forebrain, corticolimbic structures, and the brainstem, particularly to those regions related to waking and regulation of sleep and vigilance.
 
By interfering with orexin peptides at OX1 and OX2 receptor sites, GOUR-713 decreases vigilance, arousal and wakefulness.

Highcon Systems Ltd.,HighCon,,85,514347160,Highcon has developed a unique and proprietary technology for digital cutting and creasing solutions for post print processes in the Folding Carton and Corrugated carton industry.,http://www.highcon.net,Shlomo Nimrodi,CEO,Mr.,shlomo.nimrodi@highcon.net,972-54-495-5223,Michal Levi-Schpint,CFO,michal@highcon.net,,Dvir Harmelech,"CTO & VP, R&D",dvir.harmelech@highcon.net,,"4 Faran St. , Building 7",Yavne,,Israel,info@highcon.net,972-8-910-1705,Shlomo Nimrodi,shlomo.nimrodi@highcon.net,972-8-910-1705,info@highcon.net,"In the Highcon digital cutting and creasing machines, unlike conventional die-cutting processes, the two processes of cutting and creasing are separated. 

The creasing is carried out by the Highcon patented Digital Adhesive Rule Technology, DART. The creasing data comes from a standard DXF or PDF file uploaded to the machine. The software translates the digital data and sends it to the special DART canister which releases a special polymer onto a Highcon DART foil in the form of rules that once cured, will produce hard raised lines. Once the DART has been written, production can begin.

Cutting
The cutting is done by an array of high powered CO2 lasers combined with scanners and advanced optics which perform the cutting design laid out in the DXF/PDF file.

The cutting can be made using variable data for each single sheet. This opens up a whole range of new applications, limited only by the imagination of the designer. The precision of the laser cutting also makes it possible to cut much smaller details than conventional analogue cutting – unique to the Highcon systems.

Production Process
In a production run, sheets pass from the feeder along the conveyor to the DART station. Underneath the DART upper drum on which the foil has been wrapped and written, is a second drum, covered with a unique blanket-like counter. As the sheets pass through between the two drums, the crease is made. The combination of the DART technology and counter allows for creation of crease lines, resulting in products that are ready to be folded and glued

Each sheet then passes automatically along the conveyor to the cutting station and on to the stacker.

Even before the crease lines are written on the DART foil the file can be proofed by performing partial cutting, or perforations to simulate the crease.

And once the crease lines have been finalized, the cutting parameters can be changed as wanted, per sheet, to effect corrections, versions, or just last minute design changes. The laser can produce etching effects, variable cutouts, perforations (like zipper tears) and numerous other effects. The fact that last minute digital changes are possible means the operator of the machine can adapt the file to suit the correct cutting level for the specific substrate – impossible with conventional technology. This ability to control the depth of the marking, kiss cutting or etching opens up a variety of new ways to customize packaging at the finishing stage rather than during the printing.

Stripping
The Highcon digital cutting and creasing machines come with an optional built-in waste stripping mechanism that automatically removes the waste from the smallest internal cutouts produced on the sheets by the lasers. The optimized cutting algorithms, together with a new substrate handling system, ensure completely clean cuts that are essential for intricate cutouts. All the small particles drop into an easily removable chamber. This module removes the need to buy, setup or store a separate stripping tool, and further advances the productivity of the machine.","Deep Tech, Industry 4.0, IoT, Robotics"

The same machine allows also printing by a non-direct method: In this application, the printing process is done in two stages: the image is first printed on a transfer paper, then, the paper is heat pressed against the textile. The process is not limited to textile only and can be performed on other substrates as caps, hats, jigsaws, bags, ceramics, wood and more. Further more, the printing platform can be used for other medium format graphic and non-graphic applications rather than textile pieces. An important issue in the business plan is the consumables issue.

Kornit develops several ink types for its printing machine that are suitable for textile substrates. These solvent-based propriety inks perform high wash fastness, UV fastness and more.  The product includes an optional automatic unit for high throughput, and dark garment printing capability.

The Kornit ink, which was specifically formulated to work with a variety of textile applications, is a solvent based ink with very high light fastness (UV resistant). As our ink was developed for digital systems its liquidity is durable for printing using ink jet heads. Due to this, our printing overlay will never feel rubbery thereby allowing for accurate printing.

With GeneRide™, the therapeutic gene is site-specifically integrated into the genome allowing durable gene expression in dividing cells and mature tissues. Furthermore, therapeutic gene expression is regulated by the targeted locus so production can be limited to specific cell types. The company’s technology hitches a therapeutic transgene to a native promoter without disrupting its normal function in the host genome, enabling permanent expression of a functional version of a missing or faulty gene. Thus − with just a single treatment early in a child’s life – LogicBio can potentially deliver a life-long cure from a devastating disease.

1) The GeneRide technology harnesses the natural power of homologous recombination to enable precise, site-specific transfer of therapeutic genetic material without the use of promoters or nucleases. This strategy minimizes the risk of carcinogenicity spurred on by strong promoters used in traditional gene-therapy approaches.

Some of the improvements inherent to MDO films are: increased modulus (stiffness), water and oxygen barrier, downgauging, strength, aesthetic properties like haze and gloss, dead fold, twist and shrink.
 
  

By using the MDO process and designing specific films to meet the requirements of a given application, significant economic savings can be achieved: replacement of laminations of printed films with sealant and the possibility to eliminate secondary conversion processes, reduction of costs by downgauging a polymer film without compromising the overall properties of the film, reduction in oxygen and moisture transmission rates, higher package performance, less material consumption and replacement of less desirable materials.",

Yet, only one microsphere delivery system, Microsponge, has ever been approved by the FDA for topical prescription drug products.  The dearth of topical drug microsphere delivery systems might be attributed to the nature of the dermatology market, which has not justified the extensive investments required to get the FDA’s approval for a novel delivery system.  However, our products take advantage of the fact that silica has already been approved by the FDA as a safe excipient for topical drug products (it is used as a thickener and filler in numerous products) and utilize our expertise in sol-gel encapsulation processes to expedite the approval process of drugs that are based on our delivery systems.
Encapsulation of a drug substance can be made using a variety of techniques, such as solvent evaporation, coacervation, and interfacial polymerization.  Most encapsulations involve organic polymers, such as polymethyl methacrylate, chitosan and cellulose.  The resultant encapsulated drug substance can be an aqueous dispersion of varying payload and volume fraction or a dried powder.  Control over the encapsulation process when organic polymers are used is challenging and is mainly limited to shell thickness.  Other properties of the organic polymer encapsulating material are hard to control.  In contrast, we use proprietary 'sol-gel' processes to shape silica on site to form microcapsule shells of almost any size and release rate profile.  Sol-gel is a chemical process whereby amorphous silica, or other metal oxides, are made by forming interconnections among colloidal particles (the “sol”) under increasing viscosity until a rigid silica shell (the “gel”) is formed.  The drug substance that is added during the sol-gel reaction is encapsulated, in a patented technique, by which a core-shell structure is formed.  The drug substance is in the core and the silica is the capsule shell.  At the end of the process, the microcapsules are in the shape of small beads in the range of 1-40µ.
Their silica-based delivery system improves the tolerability of topical dermatological drug products by entrapping drug substances in porous silica microcapsules. This entrapment creates a protective barrier between the drug substance and the skin and controls the release rate of the drug substance.  Their delivery system also enables highly effective novel fixed-dose combinations of two or more otherwise unstable drug substances by creating a silica protective layer around labile drug substances. Their delivery system only contains inactive ingredients which are listed in the FDA’s inactive ingredients database (IID) and are approved for topical use, substantially simplifying and expediting the regulatory approval process.  Communications with the FDA indicate that the agency accepts our suggested in-process specification and analytical procedures for the encapsulated substances.",

The resulting formulations are instilled intravesically in liquid form directly into the bladder or upper urothelial tract using standard instillation methodologies via catheters and thereafter convert into gel form at body temperature.
