    "technology1": "Amiad acts as a house of technologies and offers the following selection of filtration technologies:\n\n1.\tSpin Klintm Disc – this technology operates using thin, color-coded discs of a specific micron size. The discs are grooved on both sides, in opposite directions, creating a series of crossing points which form multiple particle traps. A series of discs are stacked and compressed on a specially designed spine, producing a matrix of consecutive crossing points which trap the particles, thus creating a depth filtration element.\n\n2.\tSuction-scanning Screen – this technology incorporates a multi-layer stainless steel screen with focused flush to provide 100% cleaning of the screen area, using less than 1% of the total process water for cleaning. The self-cleaning cycle is triggered by the accumulation of suspended solids (filter cake) on the screen surface, as measured by the pressure differential. Because cleaning is performed as needed, it results in minimal water and energy waste. Suction-scanning technology eliminates the need to isolate the filter during the self-cleaning cycle. The focused cleaning and the minimal exhaust requirement allow for uninterrupted process flow.\n\n3.\tMedia – this technology, also known as depth filtration, is filtering water through a thick layer of graded particles (sand, gravel or other granular materials), called the filter bed. Raw water enters from the filter inlet and percolates through the filter bed, and suspended materials attach to the media particles. Filtered water flows through the filtration nozzles and out through the filter’s outlet. Backwashing: pressurized water flows in the reverse direction, from the nozzles upwards, causing suspension of the filter bed and releasing the suspended matter from the bedding. The dirt particles are then washed out of through the back-flush valve.\n\n4.\tMicrofiber – this technology uses threads wound in layers around a grooved plastic spool cassette, removing dirt particles as water flows through multi-layered microfibers to the collecting pipes and out of the filter via outlets. The accumulation of dirt particles causes differential pressure. At a preset pressure differential value or time interval, the control unit activates the self-cleaning cycle.",

These molecules can serve as a platform for imaging apoptotic cells and tissues or for targeted delivery of an active drug. \n\nThe Aposense molecules track apoptotic cells, regardless of cell type and apoptotic trigger, and at the same time avoid interaction with healthy cells.

High A3AR expression levels are also found in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with inflammatory and cancer diseases, reflecting A3AR expression in the pathological remote sites. Targeting the receptor with synthetic and highly selective A3AR agonists, such as Can-Fite’s compounds CF101 and CF102, induces anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects. In addition, the receptor is suggested as a biological marker based on human clinical data showing that high receptor expression at baseline predicts good patient’s response to drug treatment.\n\nThe company’s research further suggests that A3AR mediates a differential effect on pathological and normal cells. While specific A3AR agonists, such as CF101 and CF102, induce apoptosis of inflammatory and cancer cells, normal cells are refractory to the effects of the drug. This differential effect attributes to the safety profile of the A3AR agonists.",

    "technology1": "The production of Collplant’s rhCollagen (recombinant human collagen) begins when seedlings of tobacco plants genetically engineered with five human genes essential for the production of collagen are distributed to qualified greenhouses across Israel, where they are grown to maturity, which takes about eight weeks. The tobacco leaves are then harvested and processed to an extract, which undergoes purification until the final rhCollagen product is produced. Cost effective production, the abundant supply of raw materials, and the resulting product, pristine human collagen, are the most important features of plant based production. They are advancing a new production process that will result in higher yields and labor cost reductions, assuring adequate supply as demand for rhCollagen increases.\n\nTheir rhCollagen has demonstrated superior biological function when compared to any tissue derived collagen, whether from animal or human tissues according to data published in peer reviewed scientific publications. Their rhCollagen can be fabricated in different forms, shapes, and viscosities including gels, pastes, sponges, sheets, membranes, fibers, and thin coats, all of which have been tested in vitro and in animal models and proven superior to tissue derived products. These different forms of our rhCollagen broaden the potential applications of our products. For example, collagen gels made of their rhCollagen are more homogenous and less viscous compared to tissue derived collagen, making the rhCollagen gels ideal for any injectable product. They have demonstrated that, due to its homogeneity, rhCollagen can produce fibers and membranes with high molecular order, meaning all the molecules are oriented in the same direction, which enables the formation of tissue repair products with distinctive physical properties, including improved tensile strength due to the alignment of the collagen fibers, higher levels of transparency, and the ability to achieve high concentrations of collagen at low viscosities. The unique properties of our rhCollagen make it an ideal building block for many products such as BioInks for 3 D printing, artificial tendons, and transparent ophthalmic products that we believe cannot currently be produced using tissue derived collagen.\n\nThey can produce our rhCollagen cost effectively and have access to an abundant supply of raw materials. Tobacco is a relatively easy plant to grow, and can be cultivated in a wide range of climates and soils. The tobacco plant is an extremely hardy plant, may be grown in very large volumes and its growth time to reach desired maturity is relatively short (about eight weeks). Under their current production technology, we are able to achieve a cost of goods that allows us to offer products at prices that are competitive with tissue derived collagen.",

Duke brings a fully robotic weapon system to an airborne platform, by delivery of smart suppression fire capabilities with a stabilization solution. Using gunfire-locating sensors, the system detects when the helicopter is being fired at, and directs the weapon to the source, minimizing the time of response. The operator can now shoot back to suppress the threat. The system is based on a delta-robot motion that floats the weapon away from the aircraft's vibrations, for maximum stability. The system is designed for the Sikorsky black-hawk and for the MI-17; also suitable for marine applications, like steady shot for fast boats.",

    "technology1": "The Wave Clapper – For places & structures that are suffering from “space restrictions” (which means, not enough space to implement the traditional large-scale floaters), we propose the “Wave Clapper” shape, which enables to put the floaters with very small spaces between one another and prevent the need in safe gaps between the floaters.\n\nThe float is made in the form of a leak-proof capacity with a definite configuration of walls . The floater’s foredeck directed against an incident wave has a pointed triangular shape, with chamfers towards the floater’s bottom. At that, a surface confronting waves can have both a flat and curvilinear configuration. Thus, an incident surf wave reinforces a vertical force of the floater’s ascent and getting to the “wedge” formed by foredecks of neighboring pontoons, moves them apart and protects from sides clash. It facilitates decrease in lateral loads of pontoon fastenings to a pier and increase in a construction operation life.\n\nThe “Power Wing” – When operating at different heights of waves, the float provides stable operation by means of combination of several effects originating during operation. At low waves on a water surface (up to 0.5 of float depth) and low speed of wave run-up, the construction works as an ordinary float, and float surfacing force participates in lifting force creation. At a mean wave (up to 1.5 of float depth) and average speed of wave run-up, a float lifting force acts the part, as well as an additional volume of air enclosed under the “wing” due to the effect of “hydraulic lock”, when an incident wave is higher than the float and locks some part of air under a float at run-up; this air works as an additional effective volume increasing an effective volume of the float and lifting force.At a rather high wave (more than 1.5 of float depth) and run-up speed, the construction will work as a float + “hydrofoil” creating a lifting force due to a kinetic energy of moving water, Archimedes Power and hydro dynamic power.",

These premature stop codons have been identified in over 1,800 rare and ultra-rare diseases. Read-through therapeutic development is focused on extending mRNA half-life and increasing protein synthesis by enabling the cytoplasmic ribosome to read through premature stop codons to produce full-length proteins. Eloxx’s lead investigational product candidate, ELX-02, is a small molecule drug candidate designed to restore the production of full-length functional proteins.

The ability of a solid to adsorb depends on the chemical makeup of the solid and its physical structure. Activated charcoal, for example, has a very large surface area because of its porous nature. This gives it the ability to adsorb large quantities of natural gas.\n\nIn a conventional high-pressure storage tank, such as a propane tank used for a backyard barbecue, gas is forced into the tank under pressure. The greater the pressure, the greater the volume of gas stored in the tank. The maximum pressure, and therefore volume of gas held in the tank, is limited by the physical properties of the tank and its valve.\n\nThe addition of a microporous material into the tank, such as activated carbon, makes it possible to do one of two things:\n\nStore a larger volume of natural gas in the same container, at the same pressure.\nStore the same volume of natural gas in the container at a lower pressure.\nUntil now the commercialization of Adsorbed Natural Gas technology was hindered by several unsolved technological problems including :\n\nSufficient volumetric storage ability competitive with existing NG storage methods.\nEfficient gas filling and release from an ANG tank for automotive application\nANG fueling system cost competitive with the cost of existing fueling systems.\nEnergtek’s pioneering Research and Development venture the first commercially efficient system of ANG storage and delivery.",

    "technology1": "Ethernity’s core technology which is protected by five US patents, all around efficient logic design of Multi Channel Ethernet MAC, Traffic Management, search technology and zero copy operation for reordering, queue management and encapsulation, reduces power consumption and the costs of maintaining network infrastructure by giving hardware systems the ability to add “future-proof data processing” functionality.\n\nSolutions:\nNetwork Virtualization and SDN\nA shift toward network function virtualization (NFV) and software-defined networks (SDN) can be effective because many nodes within a network share the common functionality requirements, however virtualization has its own challenges. Software programmability alone won’t be enough to enable generic hardware to scale easily with growing bandwidth demands. A programmable hardware and software infrastructure is the only way to truly implement the vision of NFV and SDN. Ethernity’s product offering supports creation of re-programmable hardware solutions.\n  \nGIF-1-bordo\nBroadband Access\nThe market requirements for broadband access lead to development of a platform that supports higher throughput, new applications, protocols and interfaces without implementing a special new silicon. Combining Ethernity Networks efficient ENET architecture with FPGA create a family of products tailored to the needs of access aggregation and interworking platforms. Ethernity’s ENET access flow processors have the best available combination of performance, feature set, flexibility, and price.\n   \nMobile Backhaul\nMobile backhaul experiences a major paradigm shift from current PDH and ATM transport to Ethernet based networks. The two main factors driving this transition are the dramatic increase in bandwidth demand and pressure on mobile operators to reduce costs. This is true also for two types of network elements that any mobile backhaul network requires: Cell Tower Gateway and Network Edge Aggregator. Ethernity’s access processors provide the best solution for designing efficient and cost effective CTGs and NEAs\n  \nCarrier Ethernet Switching\nCarrier grade Ethernet services support a range of applications more easily, efficiently and cost-effectively than other network services. Ethernet services will undoubtedly evolve to take advantage of Ethernet technology and provide innovative new service features. It is clear that Ethernet services will continue to provide the benefits of simplicity, cost effectiveness and flexibility that are unmatched for a wide range of applications. Ethernity’s ENET access flow processors (AFP) are the first devices in the industry implemented on a low cost FPGA.\n  \nRadio Access\nWireless transmission is achieved today by two main technologies such as point-to-point line-of-sight communications or Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN). Ethernity offers a unique packet transmission solution for carrier grade scalable 10G mesh wireless backbone in point-to-point and mesh network based on the off-the-shelf wireless technology with maximum availability and scalability. As a result the scalable solution provides dramatic CAPEX and OPEX reduction\n  \nAFDX\nAvionics Switch\nAvionics Secured Switch extends standard Ethernet to provide high data integrity and deterministic timing. Ethernity optimizes FPGA End System and switch SoC for Avionics. Ethernity’s ENET provides the fragmentation inherent feature to enable transmission of shorter packets, which results in less overall latency and jitter. Hierarchical queuing and hierarchical shaping supports scheduling requirements of VLs. Jitter buffer functionality in ENET allows the user to gain end-to- end control of jitter in the entire ADN.",

It achieves this by blocking the action of the orexin-A and orexin-B neuropeptides at both orexin1 and orexin 2 receptors (OX1 and OX2). Orexin peptides activate these receptors, leading to transient increases in intracellular calcium levels in these neurons.\n \nThe neuropeptides orexin-A and Orexin-B are synthesized by a discrete number of neurons in the hypothalamus areas, regions involved in arousal, emotional and metabolic regulation, and motivated behaviors. The anatomical distribution of these neurons and receptors, which is highly consistent among vertebrate species, supports their essential role in the regulation of vigilance states and circadian activity.\n \nNerve fibers from orexin immunoreactive neurons make wide and dense projections to the basal forebrain, corticolimbic structures, and the brainstem, particularly to those regions related to waking and regulation of sleep and vigilance.\n \nBy interfering with orexin peptides at OX1 and OX2 receptor sites, GOUR-713 decreases vigilance, arousal and wakefulness.\n\nmAb – Allergy  \n \nBiologic - \n-Targeted therapies using chimeric monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) applied to veterinary purposes. \n-Creation of chimeric veterinary mAb by a transposition process similar to the animalization of existing human treatments (‘caninization’, ‘felinization’).\n\nCBD Oil is a plant extract, which means the quality of it can vary in different brands and products, much like olive oil or wine.

    "technology1": "In the Highcon digital cutting and creasing machines, unlike conventional die-cutting processes, the two processes of cutting and creasing are separated. \n\nThe creasing is carried out by the Highcon patented Digital Adhesive Rule Technology, DART. The creasing data comes from a standard DXF or PDF file uploaded to the machine. The software translates the digital data and sends it to the special DART canister which releases a special polymer onto a Highcon DART foil in the form of rules that once cured, will produce hard raised lines. Once the DART has been written, production can begin.\n\nCutting\nThe cutting is done by an array of high powered CO2 lasers combined with scanners and advanced optics which perform the cutting design laid out in the DXF/PDF file.\n\nThe cutting can be made using variable data for each single sheet. This opens up a whole range of new applications, limited only by the imagination of the designer. The precision of the laser cutting also makes it possible to cut much smaller details than conventional analogue cutting – unique to the Highcon systems.\n\nProduction Process\nIn a production run, sheets pass from the feeder along the conveyor to the DART station. Underneath the DART upper drum on which the foil has been wrapped and written, is a second drum, covered with a unique blanket-like counter. As the sheets pass through between the two drums, the crease is made. The combination of the DART technology and counter allows for creation of crease lines, resulting in products that are ready to be folded and glued\n\nEach sheet then passes automatically along the conveyor to the cutting station and on to the stacker.\n\nEven before the crease lines are written on the DART foil the file can be proofed by performing partial cutting, or perforations to simulate the crease.\n\nAnd once the crease lines have been finalized, the cutting parameters can be changed as wanted, per sheet, to effect corrections, versions, or just last minute design changes. The laser can produce etching effects, variable cutouts, perforations (like zipper tears) and numerous other effects. The fact that last minute digital changes are possible means the operator of the machine can adapt the file to suit the correct cutting level for the specific substrate – impossible with conventional technology. This ability to control the depth of the marking, kiss cutting or etching opens up a variety of new ways to customize packaging at the finishing stage rather than during the printing.\n\nStripping\nThe Highcon digital cutting and creasing machines come with an optional built-in waste stripping mechanism that automatically removes the waste from the smallest internal cutouts produced on the sheets by the lasers. The optimized cutting algorithms, together with a new substrate handling system, ensure completely clean cuts that are essential for intricate cutouts. All the small particles drop into an easily removable chamber. This module removes the need to buy, setup or store a separate stripping tool, and further advances the productivity of the machine.",

Kadimastem’s visionary positioning and founding principles stem from the success of Professor Michel Revel’s previous invention of a blockbuster drug.\n\nThe company is developing revolutionary regenerative therapies based on stem cells, moving away from the traditional curative therapies. The technology has been developed as a platform enabling the manufacturing of islet-like endocrine cells and glia restricted progenitors thus having potential applications for diabetes, and for neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS. The therapy is scalable and industrialized, to be commercialized as a stable “off the shelf” product and reduce the cost of treatments. For this, Kadimastem uses pluripotent cells (e.g. embryonic stem cells - hESCs) that have a unique ability to multiply infinitely without losing their naivety and to be able to become any cell type.\n\nThe product is produced under GMP guidelines (similar to traditional therapeutics) in order to reach optimal medical results. The company developed a groundbreaking process to differentiate the cells in the lab, before their injection into the patient, unlike other technologies which transplant immature precursor cells. The company’s process markedly enhances the efficiency of the treatment.",

The same machine allows also printing by a non-direct method: In this application, the printing process is done in two stages: the image is first printed on a transfer paper, then, the paper is heat pressed against the textile. The process is not limited to textile only and can be performed on other substrates as caps, hats, jigsaws, bags, ceramics, wood and more. Further more, the printing platform can be used for other medium format graphic and non-graphic applications rather than textile pieces. An important issue in the business plan is the consumables issue.\n\nKornit develops several ink types for its printing machine that are suitable for textile substrates. These solvent-based propriety inks perform high wash fastness, UV fastness and more.  The product includes an optional automatic unit for high throughput, and dark garment printing capability.\n\nThe Kornit ink, which was specifically formulated to work with a variety of textile applications, is a solvent based ink with very high light fastness (UV resistant). As our ink was developed for digital systems its liquidity is durable for printing using ink jet heads. Due to this, our printing overlay will never feel rubbery thereby allowing for accurate printing.\n\nTheir latest innovation – Avalanche HD (powered with Neopigment™ Rapid) will revolutionize how garment decorators tackle Direct-to-Garment printing.",

Yet, only one microsphere delivery system, Microsponge, has ever been approved by the FDA for topical prescription drug products.  The dearth of topical drug microsphere delivery systems might be attributed to the nature of the dermatology market, which has not justified the extensive investments required to get the FDA’s approval for a novel delivery system.  However, our products take advantage of the fact that silica has already been approved by the FDA as a safe excipient for topical drug products (it is used as a thickener and filler in numerous products) and utilize our expertise in sol-gel encapsulation processes to expedite the approval process of drugs that are based on our delivery systems.\nEncapsulation of a drug substance can be made using a variety of techniques, such as solvent evaporation, coacervation, and interfacial polymerization.  Most encapsulations involve organic polymers, such as polymethyl methacrylate, chitosan and cellulose.  The resultant encapsulated drug substance can be an aqueous dispersion of varying payload and volume fraction or a dried powder.  Control over the encapsulation process when organic polymers are used is challenging and is mainly limited to shell thickness.  Other properties of the organic polymer encapsulating material are hard to control.  In contrast, we use proprietary 'sol-gel' processes to shape silica on site to form microcapsule shells of almost any size and release rate profile.  Sol-gel is a chemical process whereby amorphous silica, or other metal oxides, are made by forming interconnections among colloidal particles (the “sol”) under increasing viscosity until a rigid silica shell (the “gel”) is formed.  The drug substance that is added during the sol-gel reaction is encapsulated, in a patented technique, by which a core-shell structure is formed.  The drug substance is in the core and the silica is the capsule shell.  At the end of the process, the microcapsules are in the shape of small beads in the range of 1-40µ.\nTheir silica-based delivery system improves the tolerability of topical dermatological drug products by entrapping drug substances in porous silica microcapsules. This entrapment creates a protective barrier between the drug substance and the skin and controls the release rate of the drug substance.  Their delivery system also enables highly effective novel fixed-dose combinations of two or more otherwise unstable drug substances by creating a silica protective layer around labile drug substances. Their delivery system only contains inactive ingredients which are listed in the FDA’s inactive ingredients database (IID) and are approved for topical use, substantially simplifying and expediting the regulatory approval process.  Communications with the FDA indicate that the agency accepts our suggested in-process specification and analytical procedures for the encapsulated substances.",

RTGel™’s components are polymer-based and are inactive ingredients that have been approved by the FDA for use in other products such as Oraqix, a periodontal gel, Namenda, an oral solution for Alzheimer’s disease, and Xeloda, an oral chemotherapy. We formulate RTGel™ with an active drug: MMC in the case of MITOGEL™ (mitomycin) urothelial gel, 0.4% and VESIGEL™ (mitomycin) urothelial gel, 0.18% , and botulinum toxin in the case of BOTUGEL™. The resulting formulations are instilled intravesically in liquid form directly into the bladder or upper urothelial tract using standard instillation methodologies via catheters and thereafter convert into gel form at body temperature. Subsequently, upon contact with urine, RTGel™ gradually dissolves and releases the active drug over a period of several hours, and is less affected by urine creation and voiding cycles as compared to water formulations.",

As recently presented by the company, the mode of action by which Immucin™ exerts its unique immunological and clinical activity, is believed to be via its distinctive characteristics as a neoantigen.  The Company has previously successfully completed a Phase- I/II clinical trial in multiple myeloma patients, after which Immucin™ was designated Orphan Drug by both the US FDA and the EMA for that indication. Vaxil is currently advancing toward clinical studies in additional solid tumor indications.",

All the patients treated displayed a specific and robust immune response and 11 out of the 15 patients also derived clinical benefit. A small group of patients were followed post treatment with some patients continuing to derive clinical benefit for periods of several years post-treatment. Vaxil's ImMucin has also received Orphan Drug Status from both the FDA (June 2015) and EMA (March 2015).\n\nVaxil is currently in the process of planning and preparing its submissions to the regulator to receive approval for a larger Phase II study with ImMucin in Multiple Myeloma patients. More recently, Vaxil signed a preliminary agreement to collaborate with the Mayo Clinic which would see ImMucin tested as a combination therapy together with immunotherapeutic products and technology under development by the Mayo Clinic.",

    "company_description": "Weebit is a leading developer of next-generation semiconductor memory technology. The company’s ground-breaking Resistive Random Access Memory (ReRAM) addresses the growing need for higher-performance, more reliable, lower-power, and more cost-effective non-volatile memory (NVM) solutions in a range of emerging electronic products. In developing its ground-breaking ReRAM technology, Weebit has partnered with CEA-Leti, the French research institute recognized as a global leader in the field of micro-electronics. Starting in 2016, Leti has played a key role in advancing development of Weebit’s industry-leading ReRAM.\n\nWeebit licenses its technologies to semiconductor companies and foundries, using a typical IP licensing model supporting license fees, royalties and non-recurring engineering fees (NRE). The technology is ideal for both embedded SoC designs, where ease of fabrication and integration of various size arrays is required, and for discrete memory chips, where memory density and cost per bit is top priority.",
